# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

## Program Description
Machine learning represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence.

This [program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) will teach you how to become a machine learning engineer, and apply predictive models to massive data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more.

## Projects
1. [Titanic Survival Exploration](./titanic_survival_exploration)  
Created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age.

2. [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](./boston_housing)  
Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

3. [Finding Donors for CharityML](./finding_donors)    
Investigated factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.

4. [Creating Customer Segments](./customer_segments)  
Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.

5. [Train a Smartcab to Drive](./smartcab)  
Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.

6. [Image Classification](./image-classification)    
Built a deep convolutional neural network to classify images from the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.

7. [Capstone Project](./capstone_project)  
Identified a relevant real-world problem that can be solved using machine learning, and modeled it using techniques learned throughout the Nanodegree. Presented the best solution achieved, discussed its strengths and weaknesses, and scope for future work.
